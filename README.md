# animacalculator
WoW Addon to calculate anima from depositable anima items in bags

Create a folder in your WoW Addons folder called AnimaCalculator, and put the .lua and .toc file inside it.

/ac will give you a readout of how much anima is in your bags to be turned in at your Sanctum.  Occasionally it will error due to caching if you run the slash command quickly after a reload.  If that's the case, just try it again.
